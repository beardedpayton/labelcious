# labelcious

Labelcious is a GitHub app built to make OSS maintainers lives easier! It helps maintainers automate comments on issues based on what label is selected. The maintainer has full control over what native/custom GitHub labels the bot should reply on and what the bot should say!

# To use customLabels set value to 'true', set to 'false' to not use customLabels
customLabels: true

# Labelcious supports infinity custom labels, if customLabels is set to 'false' set labels: []
labels:
  - docs
  - feature request
  - wip
  - cannot reproduce
  
 # Each custom label has an index to relate the comment. The naming convention is 'custom0'
 # 'custom0' would relate to the first custom label you state, and 'custom1' would be the second label etc.
 # If you have four labels you want automated comments for you would do this...
