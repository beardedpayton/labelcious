# labelcious

Labelcious is a GitHub app built to make OSS maintainers lives easier! It helps maintainers automate comments on issues based on what label is selected. The maintainer has full control over what native/custom GitHub labels the bot should reply on and what the bot should say!

## Usage

1. Install the [labelcious bot](https://github.com/apps/labelcious/) on the repositories you'd like it to help with.
2. Create a ```.github/config.yml``` in the repository labelcious is installed on.

```YAML

# Or set it's value to 'false' if not comments are not needed.
# Add a custom label by providing new key/value. key should be EXACT name of label and value should be the comment.
